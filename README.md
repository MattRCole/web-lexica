## web-lexica

The point of this repo is to create a web client that can make a game when given a [Lexica](https://github.com/lexica/lexica) multiplayer game link.

As of right now, the scope of the project is not to fully replicate everything Lexica can do, but rather just allow more people to join in multiplayer games.
